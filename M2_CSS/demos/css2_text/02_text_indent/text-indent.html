    <p>
        The first line of this text is indented.
        Other lines start at the left margin.
        This is the normal way of outlining alinea's that are left aligned.
    </p>
    <p class="inverse">
        This is a hanging indentation. It has the opposite effect of a normal indentation.
        All lines are indented, except the first. We're using a negative indent length.
