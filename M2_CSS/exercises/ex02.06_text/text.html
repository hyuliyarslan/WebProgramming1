      <p class="highlight">
        There are precious few things that could truly make 2020 worse
        than it already is. But a rare bee sting right to the eyeball
        might be one of them.
      </p>

        Doctors this week published an image of just such an uncommon ocular
        impaling. The image, appearing in the New England Journal of Medicine,
        also included a brief report of the patient’s condition and recovery.
        The details confirm that although reading about this horror show of a
        year may sometimes feel like getting repeatedly stabbed in the peepers,
        the real thing is actually far more unpleasant.

        The patient was a 22-year-old male who showed up at a hospital’s
        emergency department with redness, pain, and decreased vision in
        his left eye, which had taken a bee sting about an hour earlier.
        Though the man had 20/20 vision in his right eye, he reported only
        being able to see hand movements close to his face with his left eye.
